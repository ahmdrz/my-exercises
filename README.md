My exercises to learn data structures and algorithms in Golang

## Data structures

From Wikipedia
> In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

## Algorithms design

From Wikipedia
> Algorithm design is a specific method to create a mathematical process in solving problems. Applied algorithm design is algorithm engineering.

## Software design patterns

From Wikipedia
> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
